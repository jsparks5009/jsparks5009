I'm Jamie, a data analyst who brings creativity and precision from the culinary world to the realm of data. My journey from crafting personalized menus and performing my craft in varied, and sometimes challenging environments, to analyzing complex datasets has equipped me with a diverse skill set, enabling me to drive impactful insights and solutions.

### MY JOURNEY
#### From Culinary to Data
With years of experience as a professional chef, I excelled under pressure, managing inventory, procurement, and kitchen operations to maintain impeccable standards. My role with African Parks Network allowed me to refine my leadership and training skills across various cultural landscapes in Africa, and taught me to be flexible and think on my feet in high-intensity environments.

#### Transition to Data Analytics
Passionate about leveraging data to drive innovation, I am pursuing advanced training in SQL, data visualization, advanced spreadsheets, and Python through TripleTen and Codecademy. My background in the culinary arts has honed my adaptability, curiosity, and dedication to excellence, which I now bring to data analytics.

### Skills
- **SQL**: Advanced proficiency in querying and managing databases.
- **Data Visualization**: Expertise in creating insighful visualizations using tools like Tableau and Power BI.
- **Advanced Spreadsheets**: Skilled in Excel and Google Sheets for complex data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: Competent in using Python for data manipulation, analysis, and automation.

Some facts about me:
- 🧑‍🍳 I've been a chef for nearly 20 years and, as much as I have enjoyed cooking, I am loving learning to code and looking forward to making a career change.
- 🌍 I've traveled and lived all over the world while working as a chef. My favorite continent to return to over and over is Africa.
- 🥋 I train jiu jitsu. I love that it is a workout for the mind and the body. Don't be alarmed if I'm bruised!
- 🧊 New obsession: ice baths. 
- 🎯 I enjoy engaging in just about any activity that is competitive and conducive to friendly banter. You'll probably win, but I enjoy the smack talk regardless! 🏓🎳🏐🎱
- 📖 I authored a book about my experiences working in Chad that includes recipes I taught local chefs. I raised $40k on Kickstarter to publish it and donate the profits back to a conservation organization in Africa.
